    "# Tutorial: Measuring Group Fairness in Pre-Trial Risk Assessment\n",
    "**Instructor:** Hilde Weerts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explore how we can measure notions of group fairness in Python using [Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org). As a running example, we consider pre-trial risk assessment scores produced by the COMPAS recidivism risk assessment tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**. After completing this tutorial you will be able to:\n",
    "* apply group fairness metrics in Python;\n",
    "* explain several trade-offs between diferent group fairness criteria;\n",
    "* explain how threats to construct validity may impact downstream fairness-related harms;\n",

    "### COMPAS: A Pre-Trial Risk Assessment Tool\n",
    "COMPAS is a decision support tool used by courts in the United States to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist; i.e., relapses into criminal behavior. In particular, COMPAS risk scores are used in **pre-trial risk assessment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### What is pre-trial risk assessment in the US judicial system?\n",
    "After somebody has been arrested, it will take some time before they go to trial. The primary goal of pre-trial risk assessment is to determine the likelihood that the defendant will re-appear in court at their trial. Based on the assessment, a judge decides whether a defendent will be detained or released while awaiting trial. In case of release, the judge also decides whether bail is set and for which amount. Bail usually takes the form of either a cash payment or a bond. If the defendant can't afford to pay the bail amount in cash - which can be as high as \\$50,000 - they can contract a bondsmen. For a fee, typically around 10\\% of the bail, the bondsmen will post the defendant's bail.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the defendant cannot afford bail nor a bail bond, they have to prepare for their trial while in jail, which is very difficult*. The time between getting arrested and a bail hearing can take days, weeks, months, or even years. In some cases, the decision is between pleading guilty and going home. Consequently, people who cannot afford bail are much more likely to plead guilty to a crime they did not commit. If the judge's decision is a **false positive**, this has a big impact on the defendant's prospects. On the other extreme, **false negatives** could mean that dangerous individuals are released into society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of risk assessment tools argue that they can lead to more efficient, less biased, and more consistent decisions compared to human decision makers. However, concerns have been raised that the scores can replicate historical inequalities. Moreover, critics have argued that even if it is possible to produce a \"fair\" risk assessment, the mere existence of money bail may still disproprotionally affect those wo cannot afford to pay bail. *I highly recommend checking out this [tutorial](https://facctconference.org/2018/livestream_vh210.html) to get a better understanding of the implications of pre-trial risk assessment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Propublica's Analysis of COMPAS\n",
    "In May 2016, investigative journalists of Propublica released a critical analysis of COMPAS. **Propublica's assessment: COMPAS wrongly labeled black defendants as future criminals at almost twice the rate as white defendants**, while white defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants ([Propublica, 2016](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of COMPAS is likely one of the most well-known examples of algorithmic bias assessments. Within the machine learning research community, the incident sparked a renewed interest in fairness of machine learning models. "

    "> #### Intermezzo: Construct Validity of Sensitive Characteristics\n",
    "**Construct validity** is a concept from the social sciences that refers to *the extent to which a measurement actually measures the phenomenon we are trying to measure*. Many sensitive characteristics, such as race and gender, are **social constructs**, which are multidimensional and dynamic. As such, there are many different ways to operationalize the construct 'race' as a feature in your data set. For example, dimensions of race include self-reported racial identity, observed appearance-based race, observed interaction-based race, etc. This is important, because [how you measure sensitive group membership changes the conclusions you can draw](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03593). The racial categories in the COMPAS dataset are based on those that are used by Broward County Sheriff’s Office. This is not necessarily a valid measurement of race. For example, Hispanic is redefined as a racial category (rather than an ethnicity). Additionally, each individual is labeled with just a single category, whereas some people may identify with multiple races. It is also unclear whether the measurements are the result of self-identification or observed by police officers."

    "> **Allocation Harm**: the system disproportionally extends or witholds opportunities, resources or information to some groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a hiring scenario, the selection rate of applicants who identify as men may be higher compared to other applicants. The risk of allocation harm is particularly prevalent in cases where historical discrimination has resulted in disparities in the observed data, which are subsequently replicated by the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Demographic Parity** holds if, for all values of y and a, $$P(\\hat{Y} = y | A = a) = P(\\hat{Y} = y | A = a')$$ where $\\hat{Y}$ is the output of our model and $A$ the set of sensitive characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the output of the model should be **independent** of sensitive group membership. We can quantify the extent to which demographic parity is violated through a fairness metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When should we use demographic parity as a fairness metric? \n",
    "The [underlying assumption about fairness of demographic parity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07236) is  that, **regardless of what the measured target variable says**, either:\n",
    "1. *Everybody **is** equal*. For example, we may believe that traits relevant for a job are independent of somebody's gender. However, due to social biases in historical hiring decisions, this may not be represented as such in the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Enforcing demographic parity might lead to differences in treatment across sensitive groups, causing otherwise similar people to be treated differently. For example, two people with the exact same features, apart from race, would get a different score prediction. This can be seen a form of *procedural harm*. Consequently, demographic parity is only a suitable metric if one of the two underlying assumptions (everybody *is* or *should be* equal) holds. A limitation of demographic parity is that it does not put any constraints on the scores. For example, to fulfill demographic parity, you do not have to select the most risky people from different racial groups as long as you pick the same proportion for each group.\n",

    "### Measuring Demographic Parity using Fairlearn\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Fairlearn's `MetricFrame` class to investigate the selection rate across groups. \n",

    "* `metrics`: a callable metric (e.g., `selection_rate`, or `false_positive_rate`) or a dictionary of callables\n",
    "* `y_true` : the ground-truth labels\n",
    "* `y_pred` : the predicted labels\n",
    "* `sensitive_features`: the sensitive features. Note that there can be multiple sensitive features.\n",
    "* `control_features`: the control features. Control features are features for which you'd like to investigate disparaties separately (i.e., \"control for\"). For example, because you expect the feature can explain some of the observed disparities between sensitive groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "At initialization, the `MetricFrame` object computes the input metric(s) for each group defined by sensitive features.\n",
    "* `MetricFrame.bygroup`: a pandas dataframe with the metric value for each group\n",
    "* `MetricFrame.overall`: a float (or dataframe, if `control_features` are used) with the metric value as computed over the entire dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also summarize the results of the `MetricFrame` using one of the following methods:\n",
    "* `MetricFrame.difference()` : return the maximum absolute difference between groups for each metric\n",
    "* `MetricFrame.ratio()` : return the minimum ratio between groups for each metric.\n",
    "* `MetricFrame.group_max()` : return the maximum value of the metric over the sensitive features.\n",
    "* `MetricFrame.group_min()` : return the minimum value of the metric over the sensitive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MetricFrame` object is useful to do a thorough investigation of disparities. When we have (already) identified a definition of fairness that is relevant in our scenario, we may want to optimize for it during model selection. For this, it can be useful to have a single value that summarizes the disparity in a fairness metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can directly summarize the extent to which demographic parity is violated using `demographic_parity_difference()` metric. This metric can also be used in, for example, a grid search. All fairness metrics in Fairlearn have the following arguments:\n",

    "* `y_pred`\n",
    "* `sensitive_features`\n",

    "    * `'between_groups'`: aggregate the difference as the max difference between any two groups\n",
    "    * `'to_overall'`: aggregate the difference as the max difference between any group and the metric value as computed over the entire dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are several predefined metrics, such as `fairlearn.metrics.demographic_parity_difference()` and `fairlearn.metrics.equalized_odds_ratio()`. It is also possible to define your own fairness metric, based on e.g., a scikit-learn performance metric, using `fairlearn.metrics.make_derived_metric()`.\n",

As a result, a machine learning model could mistakingly penalize people who do not have a computer science degree.

    "## Impossibilities \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have seen that some understanding of fairness (equal calibration) holds for COMPAS scores, whereas others (equalized odds and demographic parity) do not. These findings are not specific to the COMPAS case. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proven mathematically that in cases where *sensitive group membership is **not** independent of the target variable* and the classifier's output is well calibrated, [it is impossible for these three fairness criteria to hold at the same time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Demographic Parity and Equal Calibration*. If group membership is related to the target variable, one group has a higher base rate (i.e., proportion of positives) than the other. If we want to enforce demographic parity in this scenario, we need to select more positives in the disadvantaged group than suggested by the observed target outcome. Consequently, the positive predictive value of our classifier will be different for each group, because the proportion of true positives from all instances we predicted to be positive will be lower in the disadvantaged group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Demographic parity and Equalized Odds*. As before, the only way to satisfy demographic parity with unequal base rates is to classify some instances of the disadvantaged group as positives, even if they should be negatives according to the observed target variable. Hence, provided that the scores are well-calibrated, we cannot satisfy both demographic parity and equalized odds at the same time. In a binary scenario, calibration corresponds to using the same cut-off score for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Equal Calibration and Equalized Odds*. When a classifier is imperfect, it is impossible to satisfy both equal calibration and equalized odds at the same time. An intuitive explanation of this impossibility is to recall that equal calibration requires equal *positive predictive value* across groups (a.k.a., precision), whereas equalized odds requires equal false negative rate, which corresponds to equal true positive rate (a.k.a. recall). If we adjust our classifier such that the precision is equal across groups, this will decrease the recall, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that **the impossibilities are not so much a mathematical dispute, but a dispute of the underlying theoretical understanding of what we consider fair**. Which notion of fairness is relevant depends on your assumptions about the context and your underlying moral values. In practice, I encourage you to make your assumptions explicit when discussing fairness with other stakeholders.\n"

    "## Challenges and Limitations of Group Fairness Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Challenges\n",
    "* **Identifying sensitive groups**: identifying which groups are at risk for fairness-related harms (and how to measure group membership!) is non-trivial and requires a deep understanding of the sociotechnical context.\n",
    "* **Access to sensitive features**: due to privacy regulations or practical availability, sensitive features may not be available.\n",
    "* **Imprecize estimations**: small sample sizes and the problem of multiple comparisons can lead to imprecise estimations of group statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "* **Ignore within-group differences**: group statistics may disguise differences within groups.\n",
    "* **Merely observational**: group fairness metrics are observational; they do not consider *how* the prediction was achieved (e.g., using which features).\n",
    "* **Disregard individual experience**: group metrics disregard individual experiences. In practice, some outcomes may not be universally beneficial or harmful. For example, selection rate may not be an adequate measurement of benefit if getting selected is not equally beneficial for each individual.\n",
    "* **Narrow scope**: group metrics only consider direct outcomes of the model rather than outcomes of the system. For example, the final outcome of the COMPAS model is determined by how judges interpret the provided risk scores."

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "The main take aways of this tutorial are:\n",
    "* Different **fairness metrics** represent different **theoretical understandings** of fairness, which is reflected in their incompatibility.\n",
    "* **Construct validity** is central to assessing fairness and should be considered when you define a target variable, measure sensitive group membership, and choose a fairness metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion Points\n",
    "* What notion of fairness is most appropriate in the pre-trial risk assessment scenario, in your opinion? Why? If you feel like you don't have enough information to answer this question, which information would you need to make an informed judgment?\n",
    "* A way to account for unequal selection rates is to use a different cut-off score for each group. Note that this policy has the consequence that two defendants with the same risk score but a different race may be classified differently. Under what conditions would you consider such a policy fair, if any? Does your conclusion depend on the underlying source of the bias in the data?\n",
    "* How equal is equal enough? How much overall performance would you sacrifice for optimizing for a fairness metric, if any?\n",
    "\n",
